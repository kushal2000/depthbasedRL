# Installation

## Main Environment

We use Isaac Gym for policy learning in simulation, which requires Python 3.8.

```
# Create a new conda environment for the Isaac Gym environment
conda create -n simtoolreal_env python=3.8  # isaacgym requires Python 3.8
conda activate simtoolreal_env
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# Misc

## Sim2Real Env

For real-world deployment, we use need ROS1 Noetic. This can either be installed globally or using RoboStack.

### Global ROS

Follow the instructions at https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu to install ROS1 Noetic globally. Then you will need to source the ROS environment variables in your shell:

```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
```

Now, you can simply use this global ROS setup with the `simtoolreal_env` conda environment above.

You may need to run:

```
pip install rospkg
```

### RoboStack

Note that the RoboStack option requires a separate conda environment because it requires Python 3.11+. Follow the instructions at https://robostack.github.io/noetic.html to create a conda environment with ROS1 Noetic. Then follow the installation instructions above for the main environment (skip the conda environment creation and Isaac Gym installation).
